# cityGenerator
### Basic procedural city generator tool for Maya, Python script

## Overview
This tool was developed to learn more about procedural modeling and python script creation for Maya. The tool has very limited functionality, the UI enabling users to change the base dimensions of the city, as well as the base size and height of the generated buildings. Currently, one horizontal and one vertical road is randomly created within the city to divide the buildings and create city blocks. Additionally, buildings are simple rectangles with subdivisions.

In the future, I hope to further develop this tool by adding windows and doors to the buildings and allowing users to adjust the number and orientation of roads.
